S u m m a r y

After completing my service in the military, I wanted to expand my interest in the tech 
field. I moved to San Francisco August of 2014 and enrolled in General Assembly's Web 
Development Immersive program. The fundamental skills I learned there have 
strengthened my passion towards creating new applications and technologies. As a full-
stack developer, I find more of an interest in Ruby-stack development.
